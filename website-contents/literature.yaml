What is Amazon S3?: 
Amazon S3 is a Simple Storage Service in AWS that stores files of different types 
like Photos, Audio, and Videos as Objects providing more scalability and security to. 
It allows the users to store and retrieve any amount of data at any point in time 
from anywhere on the web. 
It facilitates features such as extremely high availability, 
security, and simple connection to other AWS Services.

>S3:
  - Bucket names are globally unique
  - Names can range from 3 to 63 characters all lowercase, and underscores
  - Start with a lowercase letter or a number
  - Can't be ip address formatted
  - You can create up to 100 soft limit and 1000 hard limit per account by openning a ticket
  - You can store unlimitted number of objects in a bucket with object size ranging from 0 bytes to 5TB 
  - Objects are in key value pairs. Key=Name, Value=Data
Static website hosting:
S3 buckets can also be used for static website hosting.
It allows you the burden to manage servers.
You can use Route53 to answer DNS querries,
Certificate manager (ACM) to encrypt communication between end users and your website.
Cloudfron for contents delivery.
When end users sent requests to your website, route53 is used to answer the DNS querries.
Certificate manager encrypts the connection whille cloudfront helps serve 
the contents from an edge location thereby reducing latency.

S3 Object Lock:
You can use S3 Object Lock to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. It can help you prevent 
objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use S3 Object Lock 
to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or add an extra layer of protection against object changes and deletion.  

Amazon S3 Access Points:
Amazon S3 Access Points, a feature of S3, simplifies managing data access at scale for applications 
using shared data sets on S3. Access points are unique hostnames that customers create to enforce 
distinct permissions and network controls for any request made through the access point.
command:
  aws s3control create-access-point --name secretcats --accountid 456788765456 --bucket catpics
  questions:
1. Which type of S3 encryption shows as AES256 --> SSE-S3
2. Which S3 Storage class is suitable for data which is easily replaced (choose the most cost effective)
   --> S3 One Zone-IA
3. Which Object class in S3 is ideal for uncertain access and low admin overhead
   --> S3 Intelligent-Tiering
4. What is the cheapest S3 storage class for important data which need to be retained for long periods and is rarely accessed
   --> S3 Glacier
5. Which steps are required to allow an S3 bucket to operate as a website (choose all which apply)
   - Upload web files
   - Set index and error documents
   - Enable static web hosting
   - Disable block public access settings
   - Add a bucket policy
6. What S3 feature allows objects storage classes to be changed and objects deleted automatically
   --> S3 Lifecycle policies
7. What is the default limit of the number of S3 buckets in an AWS account
   --> 100
8. How large can an object in S3 be ? and what (if any) limits are there on the number of objects in a bucket
   --> Object Max = 5TB, No Object bucket limit 
9. What S3 feature needs to be enabled to allow Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
   --> Versioning
10. What S3 feature can be used to grant external accounts access to an S3 bucket
   --> Resource Policy
11.Which type of encryption allows for role separation where an S3 Full Admin might not be able to decrypt objects
   --> SSE-KMS
12.Which type of encryption is where AWS perform encryption operations but DON'T hold any keys
   --> SSE-C                
13. What type of encryption means AWS perform the encryption operations and handle key creation & management
   --> SSE-S3
14.What feature is required to allow CRR to function
   --> Versioning
   Hints:
   With cross-region replication, every object uploaded to an S3 bucket is automatically replicated to a destination bucket in a different AWS region that you choose.
   For example, you can use cross-region replication to provide lower-latency data access in different geographic regions.

15.What happens when an object is deleted in a bucket with versioning enabled
   --> A delete marker is created.
   What is a delete marker?

   A delete marker in Amazon S3 is a placeholder (or marker) for a versioned object that was specified in a simple DELETE request.
   A simple DELETE request is a request that doesn't specify a version ID. 
   Because the object is in a versioning-enabled bucket, the object is not deleted.
